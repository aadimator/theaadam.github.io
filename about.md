![Me and Jheel-Saif-ul-Malook]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/me_jheel_saif.jpg)
Hello, my name is Aadam and I am a student living in Haripur, Pakistan.

For me, writing articles is hard but making up software and designs is fun. I made this site so I would be able to do both. If I have an idea, I can't sleep until I make it real.  
Coding is my passion. Nothing brings me more pleasure than making something out of nothing. Even when the results are far from my ideal expectations, I find the whole ceremony of creativity completely fascinating.

## About the Site

I like to explore the vast and enchanting ocean of knowledge and collect the illuminating pearls of wisdom. Here, I will showcase all the pearls that I have collected during my journey, through experience and continuous practice.
